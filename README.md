### Conclusion
- If we decided to only launch one page to all our users.
   - We failed to reject the null hypothesis.
   - The old page has a higher conversion rate than the new page
   - And we shouldn't replace the old page with the new one.
- But the new page can have a higher conversion rate in some countries
 - The business should decide whether launching multiple versions of the page in different countries will generate enough revenue to make it practically significant or not.

These results are based on the data on hand.
